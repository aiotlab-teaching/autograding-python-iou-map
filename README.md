# Calculating IoU and ConfusionMatrix for Object Detection

In this homework we will write Python code to calculate the Intersection-over-Union (IoU).

## 1. Implement IoU in Python

Implement two functions: **calc_iou()**. PyTest will be used to verify your code. 

## 2. Complete the class ConfusionMatrix 

Complete the member function **process_batch()** of class **ConfusionMatrix** in `obj_det_metrics.py`


Note: Please do not modify the code of `iou_test.py` and `cf_mat_test.py`
