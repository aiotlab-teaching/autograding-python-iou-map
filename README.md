# Calculating IoU and mAP for Object Detection

In this homework we will write Python code to calculate the Intersection-over-Union (IoU).

## 1. Implement IoU in Python

Implement two functions: **calc_iou()**. PyTest will be used to verify your code. Please do not modify the code of io_map_test.py
